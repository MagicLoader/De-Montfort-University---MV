        <h2>Basic Information</h2>
        <p>New York, often called New York City to distinguish it from New York State, or NYC for short, is the most populous city in the United States. With a 2020 population of 8,804,190 distributed over 300.46 square miles (778.2 km2), New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the State of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban area. With over 20.1 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and 23.5 million in its combined statistical area as of 2020, New York is one of the world's most populous megacities. New York City has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world, significantly influencing commerce, entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, dining, art, fashion, and sports, and is the most photographed city in the world. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy, and has sometimes been called the capital of the world.</p>

        <h2>Character of the City </h2>
        <p> New York is the most ethnically diverse, religiously varied, commercially driven, famously congested, and, in the eyes of many, the most attractive urban centre in the country. No other city has contributed more images to the collective consciousness of Americans: Wall Street means finance, Broadway is synonymous with theatre, Fifth Avenue is automatically paired with shopping, Madison Avenue means the advertising industry, Greenwich Village connotes bohemian lifestyles, Seventh Avenue signifies fashion, Tammany Hall defines machine politics, and Harlem evokes images of the Jazz Age, African American aspirations, and slums. The word tenement brings to mind both the miseries of urban life and the upward mobility of striving immigrant masses. New York has more Jews than Tel Aviv, more Irish than Dublin, more Italians than Naples, and more Puerto Ricans than San Juan. Its symbol is the Statue of Liberty, but the metropolis is itself an icon, the arena in which Emma Lazarus’s “tempest-tost” people of every nation are transformed into Americans—and if they remain in the city, they become New Yorkers. </p>

        <h2> Today's News </h2>
        <p> As New York City continues to struggle with hours-long COVID-19 testing lines and skyrocketing rates of positive COVID-19 cases, one agency is reminding New Yorkers not to call ambulances for testing.
The FDNY tweeted Wednesday that ambulances do not provide testing for COVID-19, and patients are not transported to a hospital to be tested upon request.
The department has experienced instances of people calling 911 because they are sick and then asking to be tested, or asking to be taken to the hospital, the FDNY says, with the department now seeing a few hundred extra calls per day.
"Transport decisions are made based on medical needs," the FDNY tweeted Tuesday. "Please only call 911 during a real emergency." </p>
